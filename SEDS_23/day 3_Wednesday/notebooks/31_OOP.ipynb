    "**Object-oriented programming**, or short **OOP**, is a programming paradigm which provides a means of structuring programs such that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual **objects**. Another common programming paradigm is **procedural programming** which structures a program like a recipe in that it provides a set of steps, in the form of functions and code blocks, which flow sequentially in order to complete a task. **Objects** are at the center of the object-oriented programming paradigm, not only representing the data, as in procedural programming, but in the overall structure of the program as well. An object can be anything that has some characteristics and functions. Focusing first on the data, each thing or object is an **instance** of some **class**. Also **classes** are used to create new user-defined data structures that contain arbitrary information about something."

    "- The modular structure, in which classes are strictly separated, ensures **clear** and **maintable** code.\n",
    "- Through the logical separation of each object, possible errors can be **traced** back to the actual problem more easily, especially with hightly nested code.\n",

It is a process of **hiding** the **implementation details** from the user, only the **functionality** will be provided to the user. In object-oriented design, programs are often extremely large.
