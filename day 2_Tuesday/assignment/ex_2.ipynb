    "In this first assignment we will practice how to use more advanced data structure like dictionaries as well more intricate programming concepts such as functions. You can score up to 15 points in this assignment. Please submit your solutions inside this notebook in your repository on GitHub. Be sure to add your name, email and matriculation number. The deadline for submission is on Tuesday, October 17, 23:00 hours. You will get individual feedback in your repository."
