#Pet Names

#    Create a dictionary to hold information about pets. Each key is an animal's name, and each value is the kind of animal.
#        For example, 'ziggy': 'canary'
#    Put at least 3 key-value pairs in your dictionary.


pets = {'Tom': 'cat', 'Spike' : 'dog', 'Jerry' : 'mouse', 'Remi' : 'rat'}
print(pets)

# Modify one of the values in your dictionary. You could clarify to name a breed, or you could change an animal from a cat to a dog.

pets['Tom'] = 'stray cat'

# Add a new key-value pair to your dictionary.

pets['Toothless' : 'dragon']
